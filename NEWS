mkInumC (and mkInum, mkInumP) no longer consider a null codec result
to terminate the 'Inum' unless the input is at an EOF condition.  This
allows inums to propagate mempty Chunks inwards, which could
conceivably be useful for situations in which inumNull lets an Iter
call liftIO to unblock an enclosing Onum.
